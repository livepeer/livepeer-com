# Using Livepeer.com to do live streaming

You can live stream by using the Livepeer.com dashboard, or using the
Livepeer.com API.

### [Using the Livepeer.com dashboard](/docs/dashboard/create-a-stream)

If you are doing manual broadcasts like streaming events, concerts, or webinars,
you can use the Livepeer.com dashboard.

You can manually create streams, and directly use broadasting software like
[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to broadcast into the streams.

### [Using the Livepeer.com API](/docs/api/create-api-key)

If you are creating a live streaming platform or app, the Livepeer.com API will
best meet your needs.

The only prerequisite for using RTMP features in the Livepeer.com API is to be
able to create a RTMP stream. [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) or
[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) are popular options for creating an RTMP stream,
but you can also use any RTMP library, for example
[Streamaxia](https://www.streamaxia.com/) in iOS.

### [Feature Support Matrix](/docs/support-matrix)

You can use the feature support matrix to understand whether Livepeer.com
supports your feature requirements.
