# How to record live stream sessions with the Livepeer.com API

_Please note this beta feature is a new and still being optimized. Send feedback
to help@livepeer.com._

**Recording Livepeer.com livestreams is easy.**

Enabling recording on a Livepeer.com livestream is super simple. Enable
recording with an API call when creating a stream or updating an asset's
configuration. The `recordingStatus` parameter tells you when the recording is
ready for playback a few minutes after the stream ends.

This recording feature provides Livepeer.com users with a link to an adaptive
bitrate streaming (ABR) recording of their completed livestream.

The ABR settings for the recording are inherited from the transcoding `profiles`
set for the livestream. At this time you cannot set recording-specific ABR
settings. Playback is delivered via Livepeer.com's CDN by default.

_Please note if you are using OBS, set your keyframe interval to 2 for
Livepeer.com beta recording to work best._

## The `record` parameter

To turn recording on and off, update the `record` parameter on the `stream`
object. The `record` parameter is a boolean with a `false` default value.

> ðŸ’¡ Before proceeding, it will be helpful to review this guide about the
> [relationship between parent-config and child-session `stream` objects](/docs/guides/api/parent-streams-and-sessions).
> Understanding this core concept make using the recording feautre simple.

On a parent `stream` object.

- `record: true` means that new sessions are recorded.
- `record: false` means that new sessions are not recorded.

On a child-session `stream` object, the `record` value is read-only.

- `record: true` means that the session is actively being recorded or was
  recorded.
- `record: false` means that the session is not being recorded or was not
  recorded.

The absence of a `record` parameter on a `stream` object is equivalent to
`record: false`.

## Notable JSON parameters for a `stream` session with `record:true`

_A list of JSON parameters for the `stream` object is at
[https://livepeer.com/docs/api/stream](https://livepeer.com/docs/api/stream)._

- `id`: This string is the unique identifier for the asset, in this case a
  single livestream session. This string is also used to form the playback URL
  for the recorded session.
- `parentId`: Equivalent to the `id` of the parent `stream` object.
- `createdAt`: This number is the timestamp when the livestream session began
  and the asset was created. Reported in Unix epoch time.
- `sourceSegmentsDuration`: This number is the duration in seconds of asset
  source processed. When the livestream session is over, this number equates to
  the length of the livestream session and recording.
- `recordingStatus`: This boolean appears only when `record: true`, and it is
  either `ready` when the recorded livestream is available for playback or
  `waiting` while the livestream is still active or just recently completed.

## Reference code examples

### POST /stream to create a parent `stream` object with recording turned on. All sessions will be recorded.

```bash
curl -X POST \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer <api key>' \
-d '{
  "name": "test_stream_recording_on",
  "record": true
}' \
https://livepeer.com/api/stream
```

201 created

```bash
{
  "name":"test_stream_recording_on",
  "record":true,
  "kind":"stream",
  "userId":"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
  "id":"yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy",
  "createdAt":1595721600,
  "streamKey":"zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz",
  "playbackId":"xyz123xyz123",
  "createdByTokenName":"test-api-key",
  {other asset object keys, like profiles}
}
```

### PATCH /stream/{id} to turn on/off recording for an existing asset

Turn recording on. All new sessions will be recorded. In progress sessions will
not be recorded.

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}/record \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{"record":true}'
```

Turns recording off. All new sessions will not be recorded. In progress sessions
will still be recorded.

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}/record \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-d '{"record":false}'
```

### GET /stream/{id} to retrieve an asset and `record` value

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}"
```

200 OK

If the `record` parameter is not returned in the JSON response, recording is
**not** turned on. An absent `record` parameter is equivalent to
`"record": false`.

```bash
{
  "id":"yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy",
  "kind":"stream",
  "name":"test_stream",
  "record": false,
  "userId":"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
  "createdAt":1595721600,
  "streamKey":"zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz"
  "createdByTokenName":"test-api-key",
  {other asset object keys, like parentId and profiles}
}
```
