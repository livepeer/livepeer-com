## How to Broadcast a Live Stream

**Start the Stream**

We'll use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/download) for broadcasting the video.

Go to "Settings" â†’ "Stream", and click on the "Service" dropdown to select
"Custom".

Fill in the empty fields. For "URL", use the ingest base URL. For "Stream key",
use "streamKey" from the newly created stream object. Click "OK" to save the
configuration.

Now go to "Settings" -> "Output", and put "2" as the "Keyframe Interval". Click
"OK" to save the configuration. This makes sure the ingest keyframe is
consistently 2 seconds. \*\*If you are building a live streaming application, we
strongly suggest that you help your users to set their keyframe interval to 2
seconds"

When you click "Start Streaming", the RTMP stream will be pushed into the ingest
point.

**Verify stream status**

To verify the stream is running, you can fetch the stream status using the "id"
of the stream object by sending a GET request to
`https://livepeer.com/api/stream/`.

For example:

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{streamId}"
```

You will get a result like:

```jsx
{
  "name":"test_stream",
  "profiles":[
    {"bitrate":2000000,"fps":30,"height":720,"name":"720p","width":1280},
    {"bitrate":1000000,"fps":30,"height":480,"name":"480p","width":854},
    {"bitrate":500000,"fps":30,"height":360,"name":"360p","width":640}],
  "id":"2d10f1fd-dbf7-495b-8aef-08916507fcce",
  "createdAt":1596118509635,
  "lastSeen":1596119750455
}
```

The "lastSeen" field represents when the stream was last observed by the
monitoring system. It should contain an epoch that's close to the current time.
