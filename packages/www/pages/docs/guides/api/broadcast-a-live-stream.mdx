# How to broadcast a live stream with the Livepeer.com API 

Your users or your application will need to be able to push an RTMP stream. To broadcast a live stream, you’ll need to have [created a stream object](/docs/guides/api/create-a-stream) with a `streamKey`. You also need to know your [ingest base URL](/docs/guides/api/base-urls).

Depending on the software used to push your RTMP stream, you’ll be prompted for the following:

1. Stream Key: In some cases, this is called a "Stream Name." Input your Livepeer.com `streamKey` not your stream object `name`.
1. Server URL: Input the RTMP ingest base URL.
1. Location or URL: Input the ingest url with the `streamKey` appended. For example, if your base URL is `rtmp://{region}-rtmp.livepeer.com/live`, use `rtmp:/{region}-rtmp.livepeer.com/live/streamKey`.

### Optimization: Set keyframe intervals

Livepeer works best with consistent, short keyframe intervals, ideally 2 seconds. 

You should set or encourage your users to set this in their broadcasting software. In [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), you can set this by going to "Settings" --> "Output", change the "Output Mode" from "Simple" to "Advanced" and set the "Keyframe interval" to 2.
