# The relationship between parent-config and child-session `stream` objects

Livestreaming with Livepeer.com is easy. The first step is understanding the
`stream` object.

## There are two types of `stream` objects.

- **A** **_child_** **`stream` object is a single live streaming session.**
- **A** **_parent_** **`stream` object shows the configuration and metadata
  totals of all its _child_ stream sessions.**

Here are some core concepts about the `stream` object:

- The `parentId` of a child-session `stream` object is the same as the `id` of
  its parent stream object.
- Child-session `stream` objects are read-only.
- Parent `stream` objects are read-write.
- The playback URL for a live (`isActive: true`) parent `stream` object is the
  same for all its sessions.
- The recording playback URL for each completed live streaming session is unique
  and available as a parameter on the child-session `stream` object when
  requesting a list of stream sessions.
