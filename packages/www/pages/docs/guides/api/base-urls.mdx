# How to find ingest and playback base URLs

There are two types of base URLs: ingest and playback.

1. The **ingest base URL** is the first part of the (rtmp) ingest URL, used for the broadcaster to ingest the video stream.
1. The **playback base URL** is the first part of the playback URL, used for the viewers to watch the stream.

Your base URLs are dependent on the location you issue the request from. This is important, because the ingest point should be as close to the broadcaster as possible. Even though the playback base URL references the ingest location, playback will work for your viewers everywhere.

You can get the base URLs by calling `https://livepeer.com/api/ingest`. For example:

```bash
curl "https://livepeer.com/api/ingest"
```

And you should get results like

```bash
[
  {
    ingest: "rtmp://{region}-rtmp.livepeer.com/live",
    playback: "https://{region}-cdn.livepeer.com/hls"
  }
];
```
