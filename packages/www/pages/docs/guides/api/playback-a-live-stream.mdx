## Playback a Live Stream

Once the broadcast session is started, transcoding will automatically happen.
Users can view the live stream with any HLS video player by using the playback
URL: `{playback_base_url}/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`. (for example, with
[video.js](https://videojs.github.io/videojs-contrib-hls/))

You can use fetch and examine the playlist by using the playback URL, which
should give you the full HLS playlist that includes all 4 different renditions.
For example:

```bash
curl "https://mdw-cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8"
```

You should see a response like:

```bash
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=2145120,RESOLUTION=1920x1080,FRAME-RATE=30,CODECS="avc1.4d4028,mp4a.40.2"
1_0/index.m3u8?sessId=23351
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=2018712,RESOLUTION=1280x720,FRAME-RATE=29.97,CODECS="avc1.4d401f,mp4a.40.2"
2_0/index.m3u8?sessId=23351
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=1111792,RESOLUTION=854x480,FRAME-RATE=29.97,CODECS="avc1.4d401f,mp4a.40.2"
3_0/index.m3u8?sessId=23351
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=638672,RESOLUTION=640x360,FRAME-RATE=29.97,CODECS="avc1.4d401e,mp4a.40.2"
4_0/index.m3u8?sessId=23351
```

If you don't see a response like this, it's likely because the stream is not
live.
