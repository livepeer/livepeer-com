# How to playback a live stream with the Livepeer.com API

Once the broadcast session is started, transcoding will automatically happen. To
playback a live stream, youâ€™ll need the `playbackId` from when you
[created a stream object](/docs/guides/api/create-a-stream). You also need to
know your [playback base URL](/docs/guides/api/base-urls).

Users can view the live stream with any HLS video player (for example
[video.js](https://videojs.github.io/videojs-contrib-hls/)) by using the
playback URL: `{playback_base_url}/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`. The playback URL
for RTMP streams is delivered via a content delivery network (CDN).

You can use fetch and examine the playlist by using the playback URL. For
example:

```bash
curl "https://{region}-cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8"
```

You should give you the full HLS playlist that includes the source and
transcoded renditions. For example:

```bash
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=2145120,RESOLUTION=1920x1080,FRAME-RATE=30,CODECS="avc1.4d4028,mp4a.40.2"
1_0/index.m3u8?sessId=23351
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=2018712,RESOLUTION=1280x720,FRAME-RATE=29.97,CODECS="avc1.4d401f,mp4a.40.2"
2_0/index.m3u8?sessId=23351
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=1111792,RESOLUTION=854x480,FRAME-RATE=29.97,CODECS="avc1.4d401f,mp4a.40.2"
3_0/index.m3u8?sessId=23351
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=638672,RESOLUTION=640x360,FRAME-RATE=29.97,CODECS="avc1.4d401e,mp4a.40.2"
4_0/index.m3u8?sessId=23351
```

If you don't see a response like this, it's likely because the stream is not
live.
