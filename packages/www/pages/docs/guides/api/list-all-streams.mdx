# How to use the Livepeer.com API to list all `stream` objects

You can retrieve all `stream` objects with the same `userID`. These are all
streams created via the same Livepeer.com account.

This response will include both parent-config and child-session `stream`
objects. This [guide](/docs/guides/api/parent-streams-and-sessions) explains the
relationship between parent-config and child-session `stream` objects.

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream"
```

Next learn about
[filtering your list of `stream` objects](/docs/guides/api/filtered-stream-list).
