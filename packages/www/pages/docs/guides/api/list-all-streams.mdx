# How to use the Livepeer.com API to list all streams created by a Livepeer.com user

To list all the streams created by a user, you will need the `userId` from the
API key object.

The simplest way to find your userId is by fetching the API key information. For
example:

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/api-token/{api_key}‚Äù
```

You will get the API key object in the response. For example:

```bash
{
    "id":"{api_key}",
    "userId":"1234abcd-1234-abcd-1234-abcd1234abcd",
    "name":"example-api-key",
    "createdAt":1596047053660
}
```

Use the `userId` to fetch all the streams created by the user. For example:

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream/user/{user_id}"
```
