# How to filter a list of streams

The `/stream` endpoint provides a list of all `stream` objects, including
parent-config and child-session `stream` objects. The following filters are
helpful for optimizing your platform with the Livepeer.com API.

> ⚠️ Some of the examples show decoded JSON objects. But, remember that anything
> passed as a parameter in a GET request URL must be URL encoded.

### Return a list of all _parent_ `stream` objects with `streamsonly=1`

Excludes child-session `stream` objects

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream?streamsonly=1"
```

### Return all active livestreams

Exclude child-session objects

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream?streamsonly=1&filters=[{"id": "isActive", "value": true}]"
```

### Return all idle livestreams

Exclude child-session objects

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream?streamsonly=1&filters=[{"id": "isActive", "value": false}]"
```

### Return a list of all sessions with `sessionsonly=1`

Excludes parent objects and only returns child-session `stream` objects

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream?sessionsonly=1"
```

### Use `/stream/<parentId>/sessions` to return only sessions with the same `parentId`

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{parentId}/sessions
```

### Return only recorded sessions with the same `parentId` using `record=1`

All sessions with `stream` objects with the same `parentId` and `record: true`

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{parentId}/sessions?record=1"
```
