## How to Create an API Key

Create a free account at livepeer.com, and
[generate an API key](https://livepeer.com/app/user/keys).

Your API key should look something like `d210eded-46a9-4119-86f9-64c33e003f1b`.
Be sure to record the API key once you generate it, because you won't be able to
view it again after closing the window.
