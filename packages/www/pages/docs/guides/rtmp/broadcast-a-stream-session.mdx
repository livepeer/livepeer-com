## How to broadcast a stream session

Your users or your application will need to be able to push an RTMP stream. When
configuring the software to push streams, use the secret **stream key** and
**RTMP ingest URL** from the **stream page**.

Depending on the software used to push your RTMP stream, youâ€™ll be prompted for
the following:

1. Stream Key: In some cases, this is called a _Stream Name_. Input your
   Livepeer.com **stream key**, not your Livepeer.com stream name.
1. Server URL: Input the regionally optimized Livepeer.com **RTMP ingest URL**.
   For streams originating in North America, use
   rtmp://mdw-rtmp.livepeer.com/live/. For streams originating in the EU, use
   rtmp://fra-rtmp.livepeer.com/live/.
1. Location or URL: Input the ingest url with the **stream key** appended. For
   streams originating in North America, use
   rtmp://mdw-rtmp.livepeer.com/live/<strong>stream-key</strong>. For streams
   originating in the EU, use
   rtmp://fra-rtmp.livepeer.com/live/<strong>stream-key</strong>.
