# How to record stream sessions with the Livepeer.com Dashboard

_Please note this beta feature is a new and still being optimized. Send feedback
to help@livepeer.com._

**Recording Livepeer.com livestreams is easy.**

- Recording is turned off by default
- **Record ON** means that new sessions are recorded.
- **Record OFF** means that new sessions are not recorded.
- When updating this setting, note that in progress sessions will adhere to the
  on/off setting when the livestream began. The changed setting only applies to
  _new_ stream sessions.
- The adaptive bitrate (ABR) settings for the recording are inherited from the
  transcoding profiles set for the livestream. At this time you cannot set
  recording-specific ABR settings.
- Playback is delivered via Livepeer.com's CDN by default.

_Please note if you are using OBS, set your keyframe interval to 2 for
Livepeer.com beta recording to work best._

## Turn recording on/off

Open your Livepeer.com account and navigate to the **streams list page**,
https://livepeer.com/app/user, and create a new stream or click on existing
stream. You will be redirected to the _stream page_.

In the **Recording sessions** row, select **Record ON** to turn recording on or
**Record OFF** to turn recording off.

The page will refresh, saving your recording settings.

## Recording playback URL

The session recording playback URL will be available about 5 minutes after the
live stream ends and will appear in the **session table** at the bottom of the
**stream page**. _Note the **session table** only appears after one completed
livestreaming session._
