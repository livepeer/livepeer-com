# The RTMP ingest and playback URL

Livepeer.com routes your live streams go to the nearest available datacenter to
ensure your streamers and livestream viewers have a consistent, high quality
experience with the minimum latency Livepeer.com can provide.

These are the Livepeer.com ingest and playback URLs:

1. Stream into: `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live/{stream-key}`
2. Playback from: `https://cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`

#### Regional ingest and playback URLs

The global RTMP ingest and playback URL pair above auto detects livestreamer and
viewer locations to provide the optimal Livepeer.com experience. These global
URLs are the best option for nearly all Livepeer.com users. However, some
Livepeer.com users forgo the global ingest and playback URLs and select a
regional URL pair to have more nuanced control over how their stream is routed
through Livepeer.com's infrastructure.

While more control can be helpful, there are downsides to forgoing the global
ingest and playback URLs and selecting a regional URL pair.

- **increased latency**: If you stream into a regional ingest URL, Livepeer.com
  routes the stream to that region's datacenter for ingest. Playback also
  originates in that datacenter. If the livestreamer is far away from that
  datacenter region, this will introduce latency that could have been avoided if
  they streamed into the global ingest URL, `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live/`.
  Additionally, very distant livestream viewers will have a more latent
  experience than if the stream was ingested via the global ingest URL.
- **riskier during unforseen outages**: On the rare occasional that a
  Livepeer.com ingest data center goes completely offline, all active live
  streams into that datacenter region will need to restart their streams using a
  different regional ingest URL ... and send all their livestream viewers a
  _different regional playback URL_. This could be a bad user experience for
  your stream viewers. the stream was ingested via the global ingest URL,
  rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live/, the playback URL would stay the same even if
  the livestream had to reconnect.

If you decide to opt out of the global ingest and playback URLs and select a
regional URL pair, here's what you need to know.

1. Stream into: `rtmp://{region}-rtmp.livepeer.com/live/{stream-key}`.
1. Playback from:
   `https://{region}-cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`.

An RTMP ingest and playback URL pair references hardware in different parts of
the world. Each region is three letters, the airport code of the server
location. **Use the ingest and playback URL pair in the region closest to your
broadcaster.**

For any stream session, **you must use the RTMP ingest URL and playback URL pair
from the same region.**
