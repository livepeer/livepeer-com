# How to pick an RTMP ingest and playback URL pair

Your users or your application will need to use two Livepeer.com URLs, an RTMP
ingest URL and a playback URL.

1. The RTMP ingest URL is for the broadcaster to ingest the video stream, for
   example `rtmp://{region}-rtmp.livepeer.com/live/{stream-key}`.
1. The playback URL is for the viewers to watch the stream, for example
   `https://{region}-cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`.

An RTMP ingest and playback URL pair references hardware in different parts of
the world. This is important because the ingest point should be as physically
close to the broadcaster as possible. Each region is three letters, the airport
code of the server location. **Use the ingest and playback URL pair in the
region closest to your broadcaster.**

For any stream session, **you must use the RTMP ingest URL and playback URL pair
from the same region.** Even though the playback URL references the ingest
location, playback will work for your viewers everywhere.

### Examples

FRA is the airport code for Frankfurt International Airport in Germany.
Frankfurt is the location of Livepeer.com's ingest server in the EU. Anyone
broadcasting from Europe will want to select this RTMP ingest URL and playback
URL pair: `rtmp://fra-rtmp.livepeer.com/live/{stream-key}` and
`https://fra-cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`

MDW is the airport code for Chicago Midway International Airport, an airport in
the middle of the United States of America. Anyone broadcasting from the
Americas would see better performance selecting this RTMP ingest URL and
playback URL pair: `rtmp://mdw-rtmp.livepeer.com/live/{stream-key}` and
`https://mdw-cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`
