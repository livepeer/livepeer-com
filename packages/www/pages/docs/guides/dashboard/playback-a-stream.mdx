# How to playback a stream configured in the Livepeer.com dashboard

The possible **playback URLs** are listed on the **stream page**. For any stream
session, you must use an **RTMP ingest URL** and **playback URL** pair from the
same region.

This is how a Livepeer.com playback URL is formatted:
`https://{region}-cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`.

All sessions for a stream have the same **playback URL**.

Users can view the live stream with any HLS video player (for example
[video.js](https://videojs.github.io/videojs-contrib-hls/)).

The **playback URL** for RTMP streams is delivered via a content delivery
network (CDN). The transcoded video stream automatically switches between the
transcoded renditions based on the viewers’ available bandwidth, device
performance, and network conditions.

### What if playback isn’t working?

Look at the **last seen at** and **status** fields on the **stream page**. If
ingest was properly configured for playback, the last seen at field will show
the current date and time and the status will be active.

If this isn't the case, confirm the **stream key** and **RTMP ingest URL** are
[configured correctly in your broadcast software](/docs/guides/dashboard/broadcast-a-stream-session).

Lastly, check that your **playback URL** is of the same region as you **RTMP
ingest URL**.
