# How to playback a stream configured in the Livepeer.com dashboard

The **playback URL** is listed on the **stream page**, and it is based on the region your stream originates in. For example: https://{region}-cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8. 

Users can view the live stream with any HLS video player (for example [video.js](https://videojs.github.io/videojs-contrib-hls/)).

All sessions for a stream have the same **playback URL**.

The **playback URL** for RTMP streams is delivered via a content delivery network (CDN). The transcoded video stream automatically switches between the transcoded renditions based on the viewers’ available bandwidth, device performance, and network conditions.

### What if playback isn’t working?

Look at the **last seen at** and **status** fields on the **stream page**. If ingest was properly configured for playback, the last seen at field will show the current date and time and the status will be active.

If this isn't the case, confirm the **stream key** and **RTMP ingest URL** are [configured correctly in your broadcast software](/docs/guides/dashboard/broadcast-a-stream-session). 

Next, learn [how to delete a stream in the Livepeer.com dashboard](/docs/guides/dashboard/delete-a-stream).
