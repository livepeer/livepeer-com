# How to broadcast a stream configured in the Livepeer.com dashboard

Your users or your application will need to be able to push an RTMP stream. When
configuring the software to push streams, use the secret **stream key** and an
**RTMP ingest URL** from the **stream page**. A Livepeer.com RTMP ingest URL
references a server location. You should select one close to where the stream is
broadcasted. Learn more about
[how to pick an RTMP ingest and playback URL pair](/docs/guides/dashboard/ingest-playback-url-pair).

Depending on the software used to push your RTMP stream, youâ€™ll be prompted for
the following:

1. Stream Key: In some cases, this is called a "Stream Name." Input your
   Livepeer.com **stream key**, not your Livepeer.com stream name.
1. Server URL: Input the regionally optimized Livepeer.com **RTMP ingest URL**
   found on the **stream page** without the **stream key** at the end. For
   example, if your RTMP ingest URL is
   rtmp://{region}-rtmp.livepeer.com/live/stream-key, only input
   rtmp://{region}-rtmp.livepeer.com/live/.
1. Location or URL: Input the full **RTMP ingest url** with the **stream** key
   appended. For example: rtmp://{region}-rtmp.livepeer.com/live/stream-key.

### Optimization: Set keyframe intervals

Livepeer works best with consistent, short keyframe intervals, ideally 2
seconds.

You should set or encourage your users to set this in their broadcasting
software. In [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), you can set this by going to
"Settings" --> "Output", change the "Output Mode" from "Simple" to "Advanced"
and set the "Keyframe interval" to 2.
