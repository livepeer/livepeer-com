## How to transcode .ts segments

Before transcoding your stream of .ts segments, be sure to
[create a stream with defined rendition profiles](/docs/guides/segment-based-ingest/create-a-stream-and-define-renditions)
and
[gather a list of broadcasters](/docs/guides/segment-based-ingest/get-a-list-of-broadcasters).
It may also be helpful to review how to
[authenticate](/docs/guides/segment-based-ingest/authentication).

To transcode a video segment, `POST` your .ts segment to
`{broadcaster_address}/live/{stream_id}/{media_number}.ts`

In the header be sure to `Accept: multipart/mixed`.

A continuous livestream should start with the media_number set to 1.ts and count
upward to 2.ts, 3.ts and so on for each segment.

There is currently a limit of 1 segment at a time per stream. If you encounter a
problem uploading a segment, try making a new request for a list of broadcasters
and `POST` to a different broadcaster address. You can still expect the stream
to be at the same URL.

Here is an example request:

```
curl -X POST https://example-broadcaster-url-1.livepeer.live/live/stream_id/100.ts \
-H "Accept: multipart/mixed" \
-H "content-duration: 2050" \
-H "content-resolution: 1920x1080" \
--data-binary "@100.ts" > out.ts
```

Here is an example response
