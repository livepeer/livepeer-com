# Getting started with Livepeer.com

There are multiple ways to livestream with livepeer.com. The only prerequisite
for using livepeer.com is to be able to create an RTMP stream.

You can integrate your streaming application directly with the Livepeer.com API.
If you are creating a live streaming platform or application, the Livepeer.com
API will best meet your needs.

Or you can use the Livepeer.com dashboard to livestream without writing any
code. If you are doing manual broadcasts like streaming events, concerts, or
webinars, you can use the Livepeer.com dashboard.

Either way, the first thing youâ€™ll need to do is
[create an account on Livepeer.com](/docs/guides/account/create-an-account).

The next step is to visit one of these two documentation sections:

1. [How to live stream with the Livepeer.com API](/docs/guides/api/overview)
1. [How to live stream with the Livepeer.com dashboard](/docs/guides/dashboard/overview)

### Feature support matrix
