# How to live stream with the Livepeer.com dashboard

This section of the docs will walk you through how to create and configure a
live stream in the Livepeer.com dashboard. The ability to write code is not a
prerequisite for streaming via the Livepeer.com dashboard.

If you are doing manual broadcasts like streaming events, concerts, or webinars,
setting up your streams in the Livepeer.com dashboard will work well.

The only prerequisite for using the plethora of features in the Livepeer.com API
is to be able to create a RTMP stream. [OBS](https://obsproject.com/),
[Streamyard](https://streamyard.com/), and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) are
popular options for creating an RTMP stream.

You can also build your own broadcasting application use any RTMP library, for
example [Streamaxia](https://www.streamaxia.com/) in Android and iOS. Refer to
the
[React Native demo app](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-demo-react-native)
as an example.

If you haven’t already, the first thing you’ll need to do is
[create an account on Livepeer.com](/docs/guides/account/create-an-account). You
do not need to create an API key.

Next, learn
[how to create a stream in the Livepeer.com dashboard](/docs/guides/dashboard/create-a-stream).
