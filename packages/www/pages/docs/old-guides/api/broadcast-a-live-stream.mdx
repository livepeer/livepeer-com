# How to broadcast a live stream with the Livepeer.com API

Your users or your application will need to be able to push an RTMP stream. To
broadcast a live stream, you’ll need to have
[created a stream object](/docs/guides/api/create-a-stream) with a `streamKey`.
You also need to know your [ingest base URL](/docs/guides/api/base-urls).

Depending on the software used to push your RTMP stream, you’ll be prompted for
the following:

1. Stream Key: In some cases, this is called a "Stream Name." Input your
   Livepeer.com `streamKey` not your stream object `name`.
1. Server URL: Input the RTMP ingest base URL.
1. Location or URL: Input the ingest url with the `streamKey` appended. For
   example, if your base URL is `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live`, use
   `rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live/streamKey`.

You can follow
[this guide](https://livepeer.com/blog/first-livepeer-stream-in-five-minutes)
for more detailed information about broadcasting with OBS.

### Mobile

You can build a mobile broadasting application by using the
[example React-Native app](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-demo-react-native)
as a starting point.

If you want to use a commercial SDK, [Streamaxia](https://www.streamaxia.com/)'s
Android and iOS SDK has worked well with Livepeer.

If you want to use an existing mobile broadcasting application,
[Larix Broadcaster](https://softvelum.com/larix/) for Android and iOS has worked
well with Livepeer.

### Optimization: Set keyframe intervals

Livepeer works best with consistent, short keyframe intervals, ideally 2
seconds.

You should set or encourage your users to set this in their broadcasting
software. In [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), you can set this by going to
"Settings" --> "Output", change the "Output Mode" from "Simple" to "Advanced"
and set the "Keyframe interval" to 2.
