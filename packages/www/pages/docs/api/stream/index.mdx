# Stream

## There are two types of `stream` objects.

- **A** **_child_** **`stream` object is a single live streaming session.**
- **A** **_parent_** **`stream` object shows the configuration and metadata
  totals of all its _child_ stream sessions.**

**Core concepts** about the `stream` object parent-child relationship:

- The `parentId` of a child-session `stream` object is same as the `id` of its
  parent stream object.
- Child-session `stream` objects are read-only.
- Parent `stream` objects are read-write.
- The playback URL for a live (`isActive: true`) parent `stream` object is the
  same for all its sessions.
- The recording playback URL for each completed live streaming session is unique
  and available as a parameter on the child-session `stream` object.

| `profiles..fps`              | integer | `minimum: 0`<br />Framerate setting for the transcoded rendition. When set to `0`, the source framerate is adopted for the transcoded rendition framerate.

| `record `                    | boolean | On a parent `stream` object, `true` means that new sessions are recorded, and `false` means they are not. On a child-session `stream` object, the value is read-only; `true` means that the session is actively being recorded or was recorded, and `false` means that the session is not being recorded or was not recorded. |

| `transcodedSegments`         | number  | Number of asset transcoded rendition segments processed. Should be (`sourceSegments` \* number of `profiles`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
