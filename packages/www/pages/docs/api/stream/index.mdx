# Stream

The `stream` object represents a livestream. When the `stream` object has a
`parentId` attribute, it represents a single livestream session.

Create a `stream` object to create a livestream with configuration details for
live broadcasting software and generate a playback URL for stream viewers.
`name` is the only parameter required to `POST`.

`POST /stream`

You can also retrieve the `stream` object to get stream (or livestream session)
status, transcoding settings and attributes.

`GET /stream`
