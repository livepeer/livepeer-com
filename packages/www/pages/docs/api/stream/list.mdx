# List all streams

### Created by the same user

You can retrieve all `stream` objects with the same `userID`. With any filter
appended to the API call, the response will include both stream objects that
represent a livestream configuration and stream objects that represent a single
livestream session.

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream/user/<userId>"
```

### Created by the same user, excluding livestream sessions

You can retrieve all `stream` objects with the same `userID` but exclude stream
objects _with_ a `parentId`.

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream/user/<userId>?streamsonly=1"
```
