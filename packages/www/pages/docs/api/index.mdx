# Livepeer.com API Reference

### Introduction

The Livepeer.com API is a video live streaming API. With the API, you or the
client can configure details for live broadcasting software and generate a
playback URL for stream viewers.

The Livepeer.com API base url is `https://livepeer.com/api/`. As you make
requests, the Livepeer.com API returns JSON responses.

RTMP is the only supported method of ingesting video via the Livepeer.com API.
The playback URL will be an M3U8 file, the basis for the HTTP Live Streaming
(HLS) format.

If you are just getting started, it will be helpful to visit the
[Getting Started with Livepeer.com guide](/docs/guides).
