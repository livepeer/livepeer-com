# API Key

Create and manage your API keys in the Livepeer.com dashboard. Learn more
[here](/docs/guides/api-keys/when-do-you-need-an-api-key).

Keep your keys safe. They are not retrievable through the Livepeer.com dashboard
once created. Consider using a password manager or secrets management tool.

The `api-token` object represents an API key. You can also retrieve the
`api-token` object to get an API keyâ€™s attributes.

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/api-token/<api-key>"
```

### 200 OK

```bash
{
  "id":"<api-key>",
  "kind":"api-token",
  "name":"test-api-key",
  "userId":"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
  "lastSeen":1596874088,
  "createdAt":1595721600
}
```
