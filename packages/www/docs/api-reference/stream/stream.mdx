# The `stream` object

The `stream` object is the core building block of the Livepeer.com platform.

A Livepeer.com `stream` is a unique object with configuration data and metadata
about all live stream sessions associated with it. Historically, a `stream`
object with a `parentId` represents a single live stream session. This type of
"child-session" stream object will be deprecated in an upcoming version of the
API in favor of the `session` object.

`stream` object parameters associated with configuration settings are
read-write, for example changing the `record` value to turn recording on or off
for future sessions.

Other `stream` object parameters are read only. These include the unique `id`,
ingested `sourceSegments` and duration data, among others.

| `parentId`                   | string  | Only used on stream objects that represent a single live stream session. Points to a parent stream object.

| `profiles`                   | array   | Transcoding rendition settings. The source will be delivered with the renditions in the HLS and does not need to be redefined in the `profiles` parameter. If no `profiles` are defined, only the source will be delivered for playback.                                                                                                                                       |

| `profiles..fps`              | integer | `minimum: 0`<br />Framerate setting for the transcoded rendition. When set to `0`, the source framerate is adopted for the transcoded rendition framerate.

| `profiles..width`            | integer | `minimum: 128`<br />Pixel width setting for the transcoded rendition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `record `                    | boolean | `true` means that new sessions are recorded, and `false` means they are not. Historically, on `stream` objects with a `parentId` (`stream` objects representing a single live stream session), the value is read-only; `true` means that the session is actively being recorded or was recorded, and `false` means that the session is not being recorded or was not recorded. |
| `sourceSegments`             | number  | Number of asset source segments processed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
